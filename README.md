- 👋 Hi, I’m @mcalisterkm
- 👀 I'm interested in edge devices and sensors as a hobby.
- 🌱 And all things data related.
- 📫 If you have questions raise an issue in a repository. 
- Bosch Sensortec have announced that BSEC 2.6.1.0 will be the last release for the BME688/680.
- I have archived earlier releases (to zip files) as I can see no reason not to use bme68x-python-library-bsec2.6.1.0

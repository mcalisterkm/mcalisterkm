- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mcalisterkm
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in edge devices and sensors as a hobby.
- ðŸŒ± And all things data related.
- ðŸ“« If you have questions raise an issue in a repository. 
- Bosch Sensortec have announced that BSEC 2.6.1.0 will be the last release for the BME688/680.
- I will be archiving earlier releases (to zip files) as I can see no reason not to use bme68x-python-library-bsec2.6.1.0
